# define-messages

this package indented to provide an example of how to use [babel-plugin-react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/babel-plugin-react-intl)
 with [react-intl-universal](https://github.com/alibaba/react-intl-universal)
 
 [issue](https://github.com/alibaba/react-intl-universal/issues/7)

extract-intl.js here is a script form react-boilerplate [extract-intl](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/blob/master/internals/scripts/extract-intl.js)
 modified to be used with react-intl-universal, the only problem was that there is no function [defineMessages](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/blob/master/src/define-messages.js) function in react-intl-universe, so I added it here for now as temporary solution for my case, to be able to switch to react-intl-universe
